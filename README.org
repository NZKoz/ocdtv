* What is OCDTV?

  Imagine that you’ve downloaded a number of episodes of your favorite
  TV show. You’d like to watch these shows on your iDevice, but you
  can’t because they’re in the wrong format: XviD/AVI or
  x264/MKV. Perhaps you’d also like to use iTunes’ newest/oldest
  unwatched options when you sync these episodes to your device, so
  you have episodes you haven’t seen yet. You can’t, since this
  requires metadata: the show name, season and episode number.

  OCDTV fixes all this. One command will locate video files, determine
  their metadata, transcode them (if necessary), and import them into
  iTunes for your viewing pleasure.


* Installing OCDTV

  $ sudo setup.py install

  Or, if you’re as OCD about your workstation as your metadata:

  $ virtualenv --no-site-packages .
  $ python setup.py develop

* Using OCDTV

  $ ocdtv ~/Downloads/TV

  If no path is given, it defaults to the directory you’re running
  OCDTV from.
